              <h1>Welcome to my personal website</h1>
              <p>  Hello, my name is Sam Merham, I have been working in hospitality industry for the last 18 years; but I recently decided to change my career and acquire a new skill for something I have been always curious about; Software Engineering. It was a hard decision to leave my job, and study again, but I knew that I had the energy and determination to do that; I researched for a school that can help me during this journey and found a great school calledÂ <a href="https://www.rithmschool.com/" class = "rithm" target = blank>Rithm School</a> . I studied on my own for about four month to prepare myself to pass their technical interview. I am so happy that all of my hard work paid off and I got accepted in this wonderful school. I am so ready and excited to start this new journey and enjoy this chapter of my life. I owe a lot of thanks to my wonderful wife and amazing four kids who supported me through this journey and been by my-side the whole time, encouraging me and celebrating any achievement I make. </p>
