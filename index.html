              <h1>Welcome to my personal website</h1>
              <p> Hello, my name is Sam Merham, I have been working in hospitality business for the last 18 years; but I recently decided to change my career and acquire new skill for something I have been always curious about; Software Engineering; it was a hard decision to leave my job, and study again, but I knew that I had the energy and determination to do; I researched for a school that can help me during this journey and found a great school called <a href="https://www.rithmschool.com/" class = "rithm" target = blank>Rithm School</a> . I studied on my own for about four month to prepare myself and pass their technical interview; I am so happy to share with you that all of my hard work paid off and I got accepted in this wonderful school and I am so ready and excited to start this new jouney and enjoy this chapter on my life. I owe alot of thank to my woderful wife and amazing four kids who supported me through out my journey and been by myside the whole time encouraging me and celebrating any acheivment I make. </p>
