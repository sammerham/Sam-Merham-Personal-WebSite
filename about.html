        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I have been in the hospitality industry since graduating college in 2001. After moving to the United States from Egypt in 2005, I have worked in hotels for Marriott and Hilton. When I am not working, I enjoy road trips with my wife and 4 children, cycling and working in my garden. Some of my best memories are adventure trips including indoor skydiving and encouraging my kids to code. I am specially of my young daughter's work in Scratch and my boy's coding projects.</p>
